## Budget

Present project budget table here. 

- Budget must be by phase by team role.
- For each role, assume each contributor will be working 10-12 billable hours per week for 15 weeks per semester
- Use real-world billing rates. A company must bill you at twice your salary or more - practice proving your worth. 
- Within the team, be specific on what each role will contribute to the budget and how this will be documented.

## Risk

The following have been identified as risks that could contribute to not making scope, budget, or schedule:

- The client changes requirements mid-project...

## Acceptance

- Describe clearly what will be provided at each phase. 
- Be specific - your client may have a very different definition of vague words.
